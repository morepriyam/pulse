## ⇁ The Problems

1. **Cross-Platform Camera Compatibility**: Building camera functionality that works consistently across iOS and Android presents significant challenges. Previous attempts with Meteor and Cordova revealed iOS compatibility issues with camera preview plugins, forcing platform-specific workarounds and limiting functionality.

2. **Complex Institutional Knowledge Sharing**: MIE requires a secure, internal platform for sharing institutional knowledge through short-form videos, similar to YouTube Shorts but tailored for sensitive institutional content and charter documentation.

3. **Fragmented Development Approaches**: Multiple technology stacks (Meteor, Tauri, React Native) were explored, each with trade-offs. Meteor faced cross-platform camera limitations, while Tauri required complex native integrations for optimal camera performance.

4. **Segmented Recording Complexity**: Implementing hold-to-record functionality with seamless segment management, real-time progress tracking, and automatic time limit enforcement proved technically challenging across different platforms and frameworks.

5. **Permission Management**: Camera, microphone, and media library permissions needed granular handling with smooth onboarding experiences, especially critical for iOS where permission denial could break core functionality.

## ⇁ The Solutions

1. **React Native Excellence**: After extensive evaluation of Meteor, Tauri, and React Native approaches, React Native with Expo proved optimal for cross-platform camera functionality, providing native performance with consistent APIs across iOS and Android.

2. **Segmented Recording Architecture**: Built a sophisticated state management system that tracks recording segments in arrays, calculates remaining time dynamically, and provides real-time visual feedback through progress bars and time selectors.

3. **Dual Recording Modes**: Implemented both tap-to-record and hold-to-record modes with smooth animations, preventing duplicate recordings and ensuring consistent user experience across different interaction patterns.

4. **Smart Progress Management**: Created intelligent time tracking that passes remaining duration to recording methods, automatically stops when limits are reached, and provides visual segment indicators for intuitive content creation.

5. **Comprehensive Permission Flow**: Developed robust permission management with clear onboarding screens, graceful error handling, and user-friendly guidance for camera, microphone, and storage access across platforms.

## ⇁ Installation

### Prerequisites

- Node.js 18+
- Expo CLI
- iOS Simulator (for iOS development) or Android Studio (for Android development)

### Clone and Install

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/pulse.git
cd pulse
npm install
```

### Development Setup

```bash
# Start the development server
npm start

# Run on iOS
npm run ios

# Run on Android
npm run android

# Run on web
npm run web
```

## ⇁ Getting Started

### Permissions

The app requires the following permissions:

- **Camera Access**: To record videos
- **Microphone Access**: To record audio
- **Storage Access**: To save recorded videos

## ⇁ Configuration

### Recording Settings

```typescript
const defaultSettings = {
  maxIndividualDuration: 60, // Maximum duration for a single recording segment
  holdDelay: 500, // Delay before hold recording starts (ms)
  progressUpdateInterval: 100, // Progress update frequency (ms)
};
```

### Time Options

```typescript
const timeOptions = [
  { label: "15s", value: 15 },
  { label: "30s", value: 30 },
  { label: "1m", value: 60 },
  { label: "3m", value: 180 },
];
```

## ⇁ Development

```

### Running Tests

```bash
# Run linting
npm run lint

# Type checking
npx tsc --noEmit
```

### Building for Production

```bash
# Create production build locally
expo build:android
expo build:ios

# Or use EAS CLI for cloud builds
eas build --platform ios --profile production
eas build --platform android --profile production
```

### TestFlight Deployment

The app includes an automated GitHub Actions workflow for deploying iOS builds to TestFlight. The workflow can be triggered in several ways:

#### Manual Deployment

1. Go to the [Actions tab](../../actions) in the GitHub repository
2. Select "Deploy to TestFlight" workflow
3. Click "Run workflow"
4. Choose the environment (production/staging)
5. Optionally skip the build step if you have a recent build

#### Version Tag Deployment

Create and push a version tag to automatically trigger a TestFlight deployment:

```bash
# Create a new version tag
git tag v1.0.0
git push origin v1.0.0
```

#### Release-based Deployment

Create a new release on GitHub to trigger a TestFlight deployment:

1. Go to the [Releases page](../../releases)
2. Click "Create a new release"
3. Choose or create a tag (e.g., v1.0.0)
4. Fill in release notes and publish

#### Required Secrets

Before using the TestFlight deployment workflow, ensure the following secrets are configured in your GitHub repository settings:

- `EXPO_TOKEN`: Your Expo access token for authentication
- `APPLE_ID`: Your Apple ID email address
- `APPLE_ID_PASSWORD`: App-specific password for your Apple ID
- `APPLE_TEAM_ID`: Your Apple Developer Team ID
- `ASC_APP_ID`: Your App Store Connect application ID

#### EAS Configuration

The project includes an `eas.json` configuration file that defines build profiles for development, preview, and production environments. The production profile is used for TestFlight deployments.
